# RossLabs AI Toolkit

Developer productivity plugins and skills for AI coding agents.

## Structure

```
plugins/     Self-contained installable packages (GitHub repos)
skills/      Canonical standalone skills (source of truth)
agents/      Agent configurations
archive/     Retired/deprecated items
```

**Plugins** are complete packages — MCP server, hooks, commands, skills bundled together. Install one and it works.

**Skills** are the canonical versions of reusable capabilities. Plugins may bundle their own copies that sync over time.

### Core workflow

**Featured: build-loop** · [full docs](https://github.com/tyroneross/build-loop/wiki)

Turns big code changes into a checked, repeatable workflow. Five phases (assess, plan, execute, review, iterate), plus an optional learn phase.

- **Right model per task.** A strong model plans and reviews. A faster model writes the code. A small model does pattern checks.
- **Accountable plans.** Every design decision is listed up front. The implementer states which decisions it made. A lint compares the claim against the actual diff. Work with six or more decisions auto-routes to the strong model in one pass.
- **Review before trust.** A read-only critic runs before full validation, so cheap checks catch the obvious mistakes first.
- **Optimize mode.** Runs many tests in one Design-of-Experiments pass. Test six variables at once instead of one: it plans the matrix, runs each combination, and reports which variable actually moved the number.
- **Bundled tooling.** A debugger memory, and an architecture engine that maps the codebase before each build.
- **Catches the usual failures.** The diff drifts from the plan. Quiet design calls slip in. Tests pass but pages do not render. Fake data leaks into production.
- **Deploy and commit gates.** After a push it verifies the Vercel production deploy: it polls to a terminal state and probes changed routes, treating an auth-gated 401/403 as healthy and failing only on a 5xx or build error. An independent commit auditor runs at the git-commit boundary on every commit and renders one of four verdicts: yay, nay, suggest correction, look again.

Use it for features, refactors, migrations, and schema changes: anything that touches more than one file. Skip it for fixes under about 20 lines.

| Plugin | Version | What it does |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| [build-loop](https://github.com/tyroneross/build-loop) | `0.44.0` | The flagship build loop. Plans, reviews, and verifies every multi-file change. See **Featured** above for the full breakdown. |
| [agent-rally-point](https://github.com/tyroneross/agent-rally-point) | `0.1.0` | Repo-local coordination for parallel coding agents — records claims, checks write boundaries, routes handoffs, and exposes room state via the `rally` CLI. Advisory-only hooks surface room awareness and deconflict before edits; self-gates outside rally repos. |
| [navgator](https://github.com/tyroneross/NavGator) | `0.9.2` | Architecture tracking — map dependencies, analyze impact, and visualize your stack before you change it. |
| [ibr](https://github.com/tyroneross/interface-built-right) | `1.5.1` | UI validation — verify implementations match intent with live page scanning and visual regression. |
| [bookmark](https://github.com/tyroneross/bookmark) | `0.3.2` | Session context continuity — auto-save and restore across compactions and terminal closures. |
| [claude-code-debugger](https://github.com/tyroneross/claude-code-debugger) | `1.9.1` | Debugging memory — verdict-based retrieval and pattern extraction from past incidents. |
| [research](https://github.com/tyroneross/research-plugin) | `0.6.2` | Token-efficient research KB — SQLite FTS5, source tier scoring, claim + quantitative verification, bulk ingest, project symlinks. |
| [api-registry](https://github.com/tyroneross/api-registry) | `0.2.0` | Local doc-content cache and authoritative API source registry. Caches docs as dated markdown with a 7-day freshness contract, answers from the local cache first (Context7 is fallback only), and flags docs past the window. Tracks each package's latest-release date and emits an install-cooldown verdict — third-party releases under 7 days old are flagged, the author's own packages exempt. |

### Agents & prompts

| Plugin | Version | What it does |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| [agent-builder](https://github.com/tyroneross/agent-builder) | `0.3.1` | Design and evaluate agentic harnesses — playbooks plus a catalog of architectures, memory substrates, and production patterns. |
| [agent-astronomer](https://github.com/tyroneross/agent-astronomer) | `0.1.0` | Query your local skill, agent, and plugin library from any conversation. Wraps the Agent Astronomer CLI as MCP tools. |
| [prompt-builder](https://github.com/tyroneross/prompt-builder) | `0.1.3` | Prompt Policy Engine — classify, diagnose, rewrite, and score prompts by model tier and deployment. |
| [pyramid-principle](https://github.com/tyroneross/pyramid-principle) | `0.1.3` | Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle as composable writing skills — short-form, long-form, presentations, and audit. |

### Capture, design, and research

| Plugin | Version | What it does |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| [showcase](https://github.com/tyroneross/showcase) | `0.1.2` | **Deprecated — use `spectra`.** Folded into `spectra` v0.2.0 via `spectra_library`; migrate with `spectra_library action="migrate-from-showcase"`. |
| [spectra](https://github.com/tyroneross/spectra) | `0.3.3` | Content capture + polished demo pipeline for marketing — screenshots, videos, and usage sequences across web/macOS/iOS/watchOS, plus `spectra_demo` (spotlight focus, lower-third captions, multi-segment merge) and a tagged library (find, gallery, export, migrate-from-showcase). |
| [mockup-gallery](https://github.com/tyroneross/mockup-gallery) | `0.5.2` | Visual mockup review with component-level ratings, auto-save to file, and Claude Code integration. |
| [replit-migrate](https://github.com/tyroneross/replit-migrate) | `0.1.2` | Migrate Replit apps to web (Vercel) or native (iOS/macOS) with encoded lessons from real migrations. |
| [web-scraper](https://github.com/tyroneross/blog-content-scraper) | `0.5.2` | Intelligent web scraper for extracting blog and news content from any website. |

Install any of them after adding the marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin install <name>@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
```

### Related marketplaces

LSP tooling lives in its own repo and its own marketplace, so it versions independently
of this hub:

```
/plugin marketplace add tyroneross/RossLabs-LSP
```

[RossLabs-LSP](https://github.com/tyroneross/RossLabs-LSP) ships `ty-lsp` (Python code
intelligence for Claude Code) alongside `code-intel`, a vendor-neutral CLI/MCP bridge
that gives the same language servers to agents without native LSP support.

## Install

### From the marketplace (recommended)

Two steps: add the marketplace, then install plugins from it. In Claude Code's `/plugin marketplace add` dialog, the input format is **`owner/repo`** — do NOT paste the GitHub web URL.

```bash
# Add the marketplace — use owner/repo format, not a full URL
claude plugin marketplace add tyroneross/RossLabs-AI-Toolkit

# Install individual plugins (all keys use the @rosslabs-ai-toolkit suffix)

# Core workflow
claude plugin install build-loop@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
claude plugin install navgator@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
claude plugin install ibr@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
claude plugin install bookmark@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
claude plugin install claude-code-debugger@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
claude plugin install research@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
claude plugin install api-registry@rosslabs-ai-toolkit

# Agents & prompts
claude plugin install agent-builder@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
claude plugin install agent-astronomer@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
claude plugin install prompt-builder@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
claude plugin install pyramid-principle@rosslabs-ai-toolkit

# Capture, design & research
claude plugin install spectra@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
claude plugin install mockup-gallery@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
claude plugin install replit-migrate@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
claude plugin install web-scraper@rosslabs-ai-toolkit
```

> `showcase` is deprecated — install `spectra` instead (showcase folded into `spectra` v0.2.0; migrate with `spectra_library action="migrate-from-showcase"`).

**Common mistake**: pasting `https://github.com/tyroneross/RossLabs-AI-Toolkit/tree/main` into the dialog fails because Claude Code appends `.git/` → `…/tree/main.git/` (404). Use the owner/repo form.

### Directly from GitHub

Each plugin is also a standalone installable repo — `claude plugin install tyroneross/<repo>`. The canonical repo for every plugin is linked from the [Plugins](#plugins) table above. A few repo names differ from the plugin name:

```bash
claude plugin install tyroneross/build-loop
claude plugin install tyroneross/interface-built-right   # ibr
claude plugin install tyroneross/NavGator                # navgator
claude plugin install tyroneross/research-plugin         # research
claude plugin install tyroneross/blog-content-scraper    # web-scraper
```

## Cross-Platform Agent Support

Each plugin includes an `AGENTS.md` at its root — universal guidance for any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI). This covers project structure, development commands, architecture, and change guidance.

## Architecture

Each plugin follows the same structure:

- **MCP server** — How the agent calls tools (structured JSON I/O)
- **Skills** — When/why the agent should call them (auto-trigger via description matching)
- **Hooks** — Lifecycle triggers (session start, file edits, compaction)
- **Commands** — User manual overrides (`/command` shortcuts)

Skills reference MCP tools by name, not CLI commands. The agent calls tools programmatically via MCP rather than shelling out via Bash.
